# Introduction 
This is a console application written using the .NET Core 3.1 framework.

This app is designed to convert files to Base64 strings (both decompressed and deflated/compressed) and to convert Base64 strings (both decompressed and deflated/compressed) into files.

This console app is a precursor to my [Base64ToFileConverter](https://github.com/donegankat/Base64FileConverter) Windows Forms Application tool. It has the same basic functionality but this version is in console application form.

# Getting Started
Select a run mode when the application starts up.

# Build and Test
Developers will need the .NET Core 3.1 SDK to be able to develop with this tool. https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
